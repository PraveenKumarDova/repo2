Psalms 91:1-4

He who dwells in the secret place of the most High,
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty;

I will say of the Lord,HE is my refuge and my fortress;
My God in HIM I will trust;

Surely HE shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler
and from the perilous pestilence;

He shall cover you with HIS feathers;
and under HIS wings you shall take HIS refuge;
