Psalms 91

HE shall cover you with HIS feathers and under HIS wings you shall take refuge;
HIS truth shall be your shield and buckler;

You shall not be afraid of the terror by night;
nor of the arrow that flies by day;
nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness;
nor of the destruction that lays waste at noon day;

A thousand may fall at your side;
and ten thousand at your right hand;

but it shall not come near you;
